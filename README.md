This repository is public but I did not make it with any other use case than mine in mind. It is mostly here for when you feel bored and want to help out with a few things or play with the data yourself.

This is because I do not want to deal with IP law and all. Don't worry, I expect contributions to be trivial when it comes to assets anyway.
